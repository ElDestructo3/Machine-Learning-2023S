# Description of code distribution

The code distribution consists of 2 files, clustering.py and clustering.ipynb. clustering.py is just the converted python version of clustering.ipynb.

clustering.ipynb can be run in any software that runs Jupyter notebooks, including vscode, Google Colab (aftr uploading), or Jupyter software.
However, if such software is not available, the python file is provided which can be run using :-
python clustering.py

Do make sure that the directory (local/server) from which the code is run consists of ipl.csv as well.
